Your greatest gift to us is your support and participation in our celebration! If you would like to give us something additional, we have compiled a few suggestions at the Thankful Registry link below. 

We'd appreciate your consideration that we live across the country from our wedding, and our small apartment is already well-stocked.

Note that there is no need to get the item exactly as listed on the registry. If you prefer to buy in a store or from a different site, 
you can still mark a gift as purchased so it will not be duplicated.

Feel free to contact either of us if you have any questions about the registry site.
